# Diru
A Discord translate bot written in Go


## Invite
You can invite the bot that I host with this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=723897238972389723&scope=bot&permissions=8

## Privacy
The bot, when added through the invite link above, does not collect any personal information. I host the exact same version as in the repo on a server in Finland. When making a request to the bot, it passes the text to the DeepL API without any identifying information. Sometimes, an error may occur, this error may get printed to the server log, but again, does not include any personal information.
